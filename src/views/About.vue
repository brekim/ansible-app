    We are a group of high school software developers based in San Diego, CA. While robotics was how we met each other, engaging conversation and open
      discourse brought us together.

      <br /><br />

      Partisan politics has gotten increasingly divided, with rational
      discussions growing increasingly replaced by confrontational rallies
      attempting to vilify people with different beliefs. Social media plays a
      large role by allowing people the opportunity to attack people for likes
      instead of truly converse.

      <br /><br />

      That’s why we created Ansible—a better social network designed to cut
      through partisan politics, providing people from diverse political views a
      space to understand the other side.
